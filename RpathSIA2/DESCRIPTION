Description: The RpathSIA2 package has functions to streamline the use of stable isotope anlysis (SIA) in Ecopath specifically with the Rpath framework. The functions include formatting data for simmr, passing the ouputs to rpath, and rerunning Rpath with different within a specified confidence interval to test the sensitivity of the Rpath model to the different diet inputs.
