##### FUNCTION TO COMPARE WEBPLOTS FROM DIFFERENT RPATH MODELS #####
# this code will create one webplot to compare two different models in a single figure
# ideally, the same functional groups should be lined up with each other on the
#   x axis to make comparisons easy to see
# also not all connections will be shown, only those over a specified range set in the function
# also should be able to set a value for differences in trophic levels to be sepearte points
#   i.e if TLs are simmilar between models then the points should be the same
# also the colors should be able to be specified between the two models to make it easier to see
